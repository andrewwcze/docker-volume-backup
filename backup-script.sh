# Author: andrewwcze
#Description: Docker volume backup script
# This script creates a tar archive of a Docker volume and sends a notification(ntfy) about the backup process.
# It also removes the oldest backup if the number of backups exceeds a specified limit.
# The script uses the "pv" command to show the progress of the backup process.
# The script also uses the "curl" command to send notifications to a web service.
# The script assumes that the Docker container is running and that the "pv" and "curl" commands are installed.
# The script also assumes that the "correct_location.md" file is present in the backup directory.
# The script should be modified to include the correct backup directory, container name, and notification URL.
# The script should be run as a (sudo) cron job at regular intervals to create backups.
# The script should be run with the "bash" shell to use the "date" command with the correct format.
# The script should be run with the "sh" shell to use the "date" command with the correct format.
